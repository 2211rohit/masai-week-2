        <p class="margin3"><strong>Types of Indian Dance</strong><br>
        <br><strong>1. Bharatnatyam</strong><br>
        Tamil Nadu, South India<br>
        <br>        
        Performed on the celestial tunes of the Carnatic music, Bharatnatyam comes from the state of Tamil Nadu in South. The origins of Bharatnatyam can be traced back to 1000 BC, and it originates from the ancient temples of Tamil Nadu performed by the women of the ancient period. The dance form is known for its beautiful body movements and gestures which are called Mudras in the traditional language.
        <br><br>
        <strong> 2. Kathak</strong><br>
        Uttar Pradesh, North India
        <br>        
        <br>
        Coming from the northern part of the country from the state of Uttar Pradesh, Kathak comes from the word 'Katha' which means "story" in Hindi. It isn't a very smart guess for one to make that Kathak is performed in the form of storytelling through the body movements used by the dancer. Kathak is often referred to as the dance of love, and it can be performed by both by the male and female dancer together.
        <br><br><strong> 3. Kathakali</strong><br>
        Kerala, South India
        <br><br>
        Kathakali is another traditional dance form of India which relates to the storytelling. Kathakali translates to the 'storyteller' in the country's language. Coming from the Southern region of the country from Kerala, Kathakali is one of the most renowned and religious dances forms of India. It originates from the tales of Ramayana and Shiva stories. Kathakali includes the intriguing face movements and the heavy costumes which include the traditional face masks and body paints (generally green).
        <br><br><strong>4. Manipuri</strong>
       <br> Manipur, North East India
        <br><br>
        
        As you stroll towards the North-east India which is brimming with the rich tradition and their unique culture, Manipuri comes as an important symbol to represent the state of Manipur from the region. This dance form is performed to narrate the romantic relationship between the Hindu gods Radha and Krishna, which is famously known as RaasLeela. This art form is performed in a team with the traditional Manipuri costumes and makeup to narrate the tale of the two gods.
        <br><Br><strong>5. Kuchipudi</strong><br>
        Andhra Pradesh, South India
        <br><br>
        Belonging to the Andhra Pradesh, Kuchipudi is probably the toughest form of classical dance in India. Kuchipudi is not just considered as the dance but a whole religious procedure dedicated to God which includes certain rituals such as sprinkling the holy water, burning the incense sticks and praying to God. Kuchipudi includes both singing and dancing by the performer which is why it requires both the skill and much more dedication than any other art forms in India.

        Odissi dance form comes from the state of Odisha in the eastern part of India. The traditional dance has been derived from the Hindu temples in Odisha. Most of the gestures and movements (Mudras) are inspired by the sculptors and idols belonging to the ancient temples of India.

        <br><br><strong> 9. Ghoomar</strong><br>
        Rajasthan, North India
      <br><br>
        Wearing the heavy jewellery and the beautiful costumes you will find the people of Rajasthan dancing on the beats of music to give away their traditional dance form. Ghoomar includes the intriguing circular movements complemented by the hand gestures.
        <br><br><strong> 10. Lavani</strong><br>
        Maharashtra, West India      <br><br>

Lavani has two forms; One that's philosophical - Nirguni Lavani and the other that's sensual- Shringar Lavani. With powerful and quick foot-tapping tempo, the dance form is performed along with the beats of the Dholak.
